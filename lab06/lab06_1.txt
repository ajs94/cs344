Framing
    1. Classify dog, cat, and horse based on given characteristics.

    2. Mapping each label to the correct animal.

    3.
        a. Mapping each label to the correct animal and associating traits with the correct animal.
        b. Horse -> Horse, Dog -> Dog, Cat -> Cat
        c. One of the labels is mapped to the wrong animal.

    4.  a. { Horse: horse trait, Dog: dog traits, Cat: cat traits }
        b. defined as dict? not sure what this is asking

    5.
        a. Something identifying the animal description with the animal name and maybe its traits.
        b. To identify horses, dogs, and cats

    6. Have a dict of known traits with each animal. Figure out a mathematical way to associate how closely
        what we know matches the given traits.

Formulating
    7.
        a. Multi-class single label classification which predicts which animal a given list of traits is.
        b. (Variable) is/isn't a (Animal Type)
    8. {    animal1: [eats hay, can be ridden],
            animal2: [wags tail, plays fetch],
            animal3: [likes milk, nocturnal] }

    9. Input given via console or defined variable.

    10. {   animal1: [eats hay, can be ridden],
            animal2: [wags tail, plays fetch],
            animal3: [likes milk, nocturnal] } ?
